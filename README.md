# Toast Component Project
> This project is part of the course [Joy of React](https://www.joyofreact.com/) from Josh W Comeau. The challenge was to build a Toast message component from scratch.



## General Information
- This project was meant to solidify the knowledge gained in the course. The course focuses on React. Therefore some boilerplate HTML code and the CSS were provided beforehand.
- The main focus was to get comfortable with working with forms and managing state with context. Accessbility was also emphasized as well as refactoring code by extracting a custom hook.
- I extended the scope of the project a little bit by migrating it to TypeScript



## Technologies Used
- React 18.2.0
- Typescript 5.0.4
- React Feather 2.0.10


## Features
- Input messages which are displayed as toast messages in form of a stack
- Chose a variant for each toast message
- Remove specific or all toast messages
